# Learn Subjektify

Welcome to the Subjektify learning center! Whether you're a newcomer eager to explore the world of Web3 and decentralized applications or an experienced developer looking to deepen your understanding of Subject-Oriented Programming, Subjektify will help you build **powerful, scalable, and secure dApps** in no time.

## What is Subjektify?

Subjektify is an innovative toolkit designed to streamline and revolutionize the development of decentralized applications (dApps). By leveraging a subject-oriented programming approach, Subjektify simplifies the creation, management, and scaling of dApps, making it easier for developers to build robust, scalable, and secure decentralized solutions.

### Core Components

#### Subjektify CLI

The Subjektify Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool that aids developers in scaffolding, developing, and managing their dApp projects. It provides a range of commands to initialize new projects, generate code from Subjekt definitions, and deploy applications.

#### Subjekt IDL

Subjektify features a specialized interface definition language (IDL) called Subjekt. This language is used to define and manage the data structures, states, and behaviors that make up a dApp's architecture. Subjekt IDL ensures that the components of a dApp are well-structured and easy to manage.

#### Plugins and Blueprints

To enhance modularity and extensibility, Subjektify includes a variety of plugins and blueprints. Plugins add specific functionalities to your project, while blueprints provide predefined architectures and templates to speed up development and ensure best practices are followed.

## Fast Track ⏱️ {#fast-track}

Understand Subjektify in just a few minutes by following our fast track guide:

1. Install Node.js from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Create up your first Subjektify project:

   ```bash
   npx subjektify create my-dapp -b subjektify/react-hardhat-typescript
   ```

:::tip

Subjektify enhances modularity and extensibility by allowing you to utilize [Blueprints](https://blueprints.subjektify.dev) to jumpstart your project efficiently.

3. Navigate into your project directory and start the development server:

   ```bash
   cd my-dapp
   npm start
   ```

4. Open [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and start exploring the Subjektify toolkit.
